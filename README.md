# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Introduction

Hey! I'm **Venkat Kondamuri**, a second year CS major.
I often go by **Venk**, especially when I see another person
struggling to say my name; I don't mind being called by either! 

## Lab Information

* Status
   * Completed 
* Issues that I encountered along the way:
   * None
* Anything you have questions about:
   * Is there any possibility for CSC 300 to be double counted as a GE C4? It mostly fits the requirements of a general C4 class but it costs a lot of money to pay for another C4 as an out of state student.
